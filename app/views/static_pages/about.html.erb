				<h2>About ClyQe</h2>
				<p>
					We are three friends with different photography experiences, but we understand the need to create a home for photographers to share their gears, their experiences, and their knowledges. Our vision is to design ClyQe such that itâ€™s more than just a place to rent gears, but also a safe community for photographers to share techniques, and favorite local places.
