				<h2>About ClyQe</h2>
				<p>
					We are three friends with different photography experiences, but we understand the need to create a home for photographers to share their gears, their experiences, and their knowledges. Our vision is to design ClyQe such that itâ€™s more than just a place to rent gears, but also a safe community for photographers to share techniques, and favorite local places.

							Mark has been avid photographer for over 10 years. His interest in photography started in high school where he took a class in photgraphy and learned how to process pictures in the dark room. He started to travel more and bought a point and shoot camera. He interested in photography increased and one spontaneous day bought a DSLR. That day change his life and his wallet. He bought more lenses, change camera bodies and started buying accessories. His interested peaked when he discovered the Strobist blog and started playing with off camera flash and lighting techniques. At the same time, he discovered he accumalate too much gear and his wife was not pleased with the amount of time and money spent on this hobby. One day after a backpacking trip where the amount of camera gear he brought on that trip almost broke his back, he decided that that he needed to downsize his equipment that he cherished and adored. He sold all his DSLR gear and is now using Micro 4/3 equipment. He still misses all his old gear but is glad he has friend he can borrow from.
