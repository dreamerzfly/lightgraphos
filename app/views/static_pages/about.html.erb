				<h2>About ClyQe</h2>
				<p>
					We are three friends with different photography experiences, but we understand the need to create a home for photographers to share their gears, their experiences, and their knowledges. Our vision is to design ClyQe such that itâ€™s more than just a place to rent gears, but also a safe community for photographers to share techniques, and favorite local places.

							Mark has been an avid photographer for over 10 years. His interest in photography started in high school. While preparing for a trip he spontaneously  bought a DSLR. That day changed his life and his wallet forever. Over time he acquired more lenses, changed camera bodies and purchased additional accessories. The amount of gear started to pile up. His wife was not pleased with the amount of time and money spent on this hobby which prompted him to sell most of his gear. He still misses all his old gear but is glad he has friends like Victor and Tiffanie that he can borrow from. Mark works in tech industry and has M.S in Software Engineering and MBA from San Jose State University.

						<p>
							Tiffanie's passion for photography started when she experimented with her family's first digital camera. Travelling to beautiful places had inspired her to become a better photographer.  Bitten by the travel bug, she would never leave home without a camera.
							
							A few years later, she met Mark and Victor who helped to blossom her photography skills.The three began sharing camera equipment, photography and travel tips. Why not share their ideas, and tips with others? Then Clyqe was formed.

							Tiffanie lives in the heart of silicon valley and is working in the high tech industry. She holds a B.S. in Computer Science from UC Davis and is pursuing her MBA in Marketing.
